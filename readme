::: What is this? :::
This is a template for interactive GUI-driven programs in Java, using Processing as the graphical library.
It provides many functions and objects to control an application, and uses my Interaction library, which provides simple, but customizable buttons, sliders and other interaction elements.
There is an in-built sound system, input tracking system and a time control system.
It is based on my ConsoleCommander game.

::: How to use it? :::
To use this, start by looking main.java, where a simple example have been added.
